              "analysis": "## High-Level Explanation:\n\nThe Python script `Extract_log.py` is designed to extract files from a raw disk image. It uses the `pytsk3` library, which is a Python wrapper for the Sleuth Kit, a suite of tools for digital forensics.  The script defines a custom class `TSK_IMG_INFO` to handle opening and reading raw disk images efficiently.  The core functionality lies in the `extract_file` function, which takes a file system object, a file entry, an output directory, and a parent path as input. It then extracts the file specified by the file entry from the disk image and saves it to the specified output directory, mirroring the directory structure from the image.
